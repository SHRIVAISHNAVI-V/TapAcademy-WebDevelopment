        Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside the web browser. It uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it efficient and suitable for building scalable, real-time applications such as chat apps or APIs. Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine (from Google Chrome) and is commonly used with the Express.js framework to develop fast and lightweight web servers and backend systems.
