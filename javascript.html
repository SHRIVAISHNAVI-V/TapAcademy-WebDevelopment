        JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It runs directly in web browsers, allowing developers to build features like image sliders, form validations, and live content updates without reloading the page. JavaScript works closely with HTML and CSS to enhance user experiences and is a core technology of the web. Modern JavaScript also supports server-side development through environments like Node.js, making it versatile for full-stack development.
