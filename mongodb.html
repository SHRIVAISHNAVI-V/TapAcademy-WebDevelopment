        MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, document-based format using JSON-like objects called BSON. Unlike MySQL, MongoDB doesn't require a fixed schema, which means you can store different fields in different documents within the same collection. This makes it ideal for applications with evolving or unstructured data, such as real-time analytics, social media apps, and IoT platforms. MongoDB is known for its scalability and high performance, especially when handling large volumes of diverse or complex data.
