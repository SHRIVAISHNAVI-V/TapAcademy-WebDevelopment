    <p>
        Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, meaning it comes with many built-in features like an admin panel, authentication, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), and routing. Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture and is known for encouraging clean, pragmatic design and reducing the amount of code needed to build web applications.
