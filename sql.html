        MySQL is a popular relational database management system (RDBMS) that stores data in tables with rows and columns, similar to Excel. It uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to define, access, and manipulate the data. MySQL is ideal for applications where data relationships are well-defined and consistent, such as banking systems, inventory management, or content management systems. It follows a strict schema, meaning each table must have a predefined structure, and any changes to the structure require altering the schema. MySQL is widely used with technologies like PHP, Java, and Python in web development.
