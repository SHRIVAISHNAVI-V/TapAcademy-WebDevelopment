    <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic content for websites. It is a lightweight, cross-platform, and single-threaded programming language. It's an interpreted language that executes code line by line, providing more flexibility.
        JavaScript on Client Side: On the client side, JavaScript works along with HTML and CSS. HTML adds structure to a web page, CSS styles it, and JavaScript brings it to life by allowing users to interact with elements on the page, such as actions on clicking buttons, filling out forms, and showing animations. JavaScript on the client side is directly executed in the user's browser.
JavaScript on Server Side: On the Server side (on Web Servers), JavaScript is used to access databases, file handling, and security features to send responses, to browsers.
