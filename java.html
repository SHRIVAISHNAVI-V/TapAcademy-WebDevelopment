    <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Known for its platform independence, Java allows developers to write code once and run it anywhere using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is widely used in building enterprise applications, mobile applications (especially Android), web servers, and large-scale systems. Java emphasizes readability, reusability, and maintainability through its strong object-oriented structure. With a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, Java remains one of the most popular and reliable programming languages in the software industry today.</p>
